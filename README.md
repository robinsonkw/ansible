# ansible_disa

# Overview
This project implements recommendations from the DOD Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) for increasing security on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux system.  These recommendations are encapsulated in a body of work called a Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG).  Various cyber security accreditation plans require risk mitigations that are met by implementing the DISA STIG.  As such, we need an automated way of applying the mitigations to a computer system.

Ansible is a centralized configuration management tool that can perform virtually any task that a system administrator would require, but in a scripted, automated fashion.  This project reflects the code base for Ansible that implements the DOD DISA STIG for RHEL 7.
